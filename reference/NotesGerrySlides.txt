Of, By and For the People



by Angelo Patrick Arteman



1)	The future is created through our collective intent

	

	When we focus on a positive goal or objective, it can be achieved
	
	and a negative outcome avoided


	
Do not fight or try to change an existing failed system
	
	

	Create a new, inclusive, global system that is people oriented
	


2)	Keys to a Sustainable System:

	

	Transparency

	

	Decentralization of Power
	
	

	Simple and easy to understand
	
	

	Local area governments all over the planet with parallel stucture
	
	

	Central global government to represent each of the local areas
	and the People
	
	

	All People are Global or Terran Citizens
	
	

	Making sure everyones basic needs are met without reservation first
	
	

	The build a new global civilization on that solid foundation
	


3)	In any system of political order, the collective becomes very powerful.

	

	the only way to protect the individual is with a Strong Declaration of Rights
	
	

	A well written, simple, Declaration of Individual Rights eliminates
	
	the need for most laws
	
	

	Public Forums for actual Debate
	
	

	No party affilliation required
	
	

	No Money allowed in campaigns
