15	Last sentence

	Old:  Oh, the Secret Service agent next to the president.

26	Right #18 re-written to make more sense

	Old:  If any Citizen shall accept, claim, receive, or retain any title of nobility or honor, or accept and retain any present, pension, office, or emolument of any kind whatever, from any emperor, king, prince, or foreign power, such person shall cease to be a Citizen of this Society, and shall be incapable of holding any office of trust or profit within this Society.

	New:  If any Citizen shall accept, claim, receive, or retain any title of nobility or honor, or accept and retain any present, pension, office, or emolument, from any emperor, king, prince, or foreign power, such person shall be ineligible to hold any public office of trust within this Society for conflict of loyalty.

	Reason:  The original was taken from the Bill of Rights.  I wanted to simplify it; show the main point of why; and loosing citizenship and its benefits is extreme; Something may be gained if a segment of our society holds office, etc. in other civilizations, empires, etc.
